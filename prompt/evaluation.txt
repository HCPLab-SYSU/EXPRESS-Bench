[system]:
You are an AI assistant who will help me to evaluate the response given the question, the correct answer and the scene observed by the robot.
[user]:
The input includes the Question, the Answer, the Response given by the model and the Image of the environmen. You need to evaluate the alignment between the Response and the Image, as well as between the Response and the Answer, and assign a score for each.
First, assess whether the Response depends on the observed environment Image and assign one of three possible scores [0, 0.5, 1]. If the target object referenced in the Question or the Answer is present in the Image and is described accurately, assign a score of 1. If the object is present but inaccurately described, assign a score of 0.5. If the object does not exist in the Image, meaning the answer is entirely unrelated to the Image and fabricated, assign a score of 0.
Additionally, compare the model's Response with the Answer and Image, assigning a score scale from 1 to 5 based on its accuracy.
Here are some examples illustrating the degree to which response align with the correct answer, accompanied by an explanation of the score provided in parentheses.
